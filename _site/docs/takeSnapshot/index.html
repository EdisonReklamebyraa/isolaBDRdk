<p>Take snapshot provides you with the entire application’s state serialized to JSON, by default, but you may also pass in stores to take a snapshot of a subset of the application’s state.</p>

<p>Snapshots are a core component of alt. The idea is that at any given point in time you can <code>takeSnapshot</code> and have your entire application’s state
serialized for persistence, transferring, logging, or debugging.</p>

<p><code>js
var snapshot = alt.takeSnapshot();
var partialSnapshot = alt.takeSnapshot(Store1, Store3);
</code></p>
