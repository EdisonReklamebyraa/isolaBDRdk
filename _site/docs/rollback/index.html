<p>If you’ve screwed up the state, or you just feel like rolling back you can call <code>alt.rollback()</code>. Rollback is pretty dumb in the sense that it’s not automatic in case of errors, and it only rolls back to the last saved snapshot, meaning you have to save a snapshot first in order to roll back.</p>

<p><code>js
// reset state to last saved snapshot
alt.rollback();
</code></p>
